In PCA:

The scree plot displays the eigenvalues of each principal component, where each eigenvalue represents the amount of variance explained by that particular component.
The plot typically shows these eigenvalues against the number of components, often starting from the first component to the last.
In Factor Analysis:

In factor analysis, the scree plot shows the variance or eigenvalues of factors.
It helps in deciding how many factors to keep based on their relative significance in explaining the variance observed in the data.
The main purpose of a scree plot is to identify the point at which adding more components/factors stops significantly contributing to the explanation of variance. The plot shows an "elbow" or a point where the eigenvalues start to level off, indicating that additional components/factors might not explain much more variance than the existing ones.

Researchers often use this plot to determine a suitable number of components/factors to retain in their analysis. The point where the eigenvalues level off or the slope becomes less steep can be chosen as a cutoff for selecting the optimal number of components/factors.

It's a visual aid that helps in making informed decisions about dimensionality reduction, ensuring a balance between capturing enough variance in the data while avoiding overfitting or capturing noise.
